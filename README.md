# 3.2-MSD-Project

## Automatic Pill Dispenser 

### Objective
Our projectâ€™s main aim is to make a smart medicine box for those users
who regularly take medicines and the prescription of their medicine is very
long as it is hard to remember to patients and also for their care giver.
Also Old age patients suffer from problems of forget to take pills on proper
time which causes certain health issues for patients having permanent diseases like diabetes, blood pressure, breathing problem, heart problems,
cancer diseases etc. Thus based on these problems we have decided to
make Medi-minder which will solve these problems by setting up time
table of prescribed medicines given in prescription. This smart box be
served for some more purposes such as pulse rate measurement, temperature and humidity measurement of room. The environmental control is
very important for a patient. So, he/she needs to know that. A patient
also needs to know his/her pulse rate. Pulse rate indicates the strength
of the pulse. Our Medi-minder will serve these purposes for patients to
ensure healthy life.

### Required Components
These following parts and tools are required for building this project
- Arduino Mega 2560: The Arduino MEGA 2560 can be used to design for projects that require more I/O lines, more sketch memory and more RAM. With 54 digital I/O pins, 16 analog inputs and
a larger space for your sketch it is the recommended board for 3D
printers and robotics projects. In our project it is used to connect
and control all the different modules.

- RTC(Real Time Clock for Alarm): The RTC module is used
to set the time for alarm.
1
- POT(10k): Manually varies resistance to control the flow of electric
current. Used to get different distance value from ultrasonic sensor.
- Servo Motor: In our project, Servo motor is used to move the
wheel backward and open the box cover.
- Push Button: Causes a temporary change in the state of an electrical circuit. Used to turn on the heartbeat sensor to take pulse and
measure pulse rate.
- 4*4 matrix Keypad: Allows to quickly input numeric values. For
our project it is used to take input to set alarm for a specific time.
- Buzzer: Typically used as alarm devices. In our project buzzers
are used for alarms and confirmation sounds.
- Box: Box is used in our project to keep pills.
- Resistor(1k and 10k): Implements electrical resistance as a circuit
element. Used for the same purpose in our project.
- 16*2 LCD Display: Uses LCD technology to display characters.
Used to show various texts and data in our project.
- 20*4 LCD Display: Uses LCD technology to display characters.
Used to show various texts and data in our project.
- LED: It emits light when current flows through it. In our project
LED is used to represent various light bulbs when the alarm goes on
at the specified time.
- Breadboard: Used to make quick electrical connections between
components.
- Male-male/ female-female/ male-female jumper wires: Generally used to connect various components together. Used for the
same purpose in our project.
- Battery(9volt): Acts as power source. Used for the same purpose
in our project.
- Ultrasonic sensor: Ultrasonic sensors work by emitting sound
waves at a frequency too high for humans to hear. They then wait
for the sound to be reflected back, calculating distance based on the
time required. This is similar to how radar measures the time it
2
takes a radio wave to return after hitting an object. Used for the
same purpose in our project.
- Heartbeat sensor: The Heartbeat sensor is used to measure pulse
rate.
- Logic-state: Used to take as pulse in our project.
- DHT22 sensor: The DHT22 sensor is used to measure room temperature and humidity in our project.
